## Introduction

- Project developed using:
  - React v18.2.0;
  - Vite 4.1.0;
  - Styled Components;
  - React Hooks and a custom hook for user authentication;
  - Integration with [APIRest](https://github.com/pedromsra/FoodExplorer_API) that I developed in NodeJS (documentation available);
  - EFI's Pix API (GerenciaNet) (work in progress).

- Key features:
  - User authentication as Admin and Default;
  - Admin can:
    - Create and edit dishes (with image uploads);
  - Users can:
    - Favorite dishes;
    - View dish details;
    - Add dishes to their shopping list (in the application, added dishes are saved in local storage to compose the "cart");
    - View their list of added dishes ("cart");
    - Work in progress: payment (Pix and credit) and order completion.
